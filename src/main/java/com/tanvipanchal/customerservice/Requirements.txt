Scenario: You need to build a microservice for managing customer records. The microservice should have the following endpoints:

Create a Customer:

Method: POST
URL: /customers
Request body: JSON representing customer details (e.g., name, email, phone).


Get a Customer:

Method: GET
URL: /customers/{customerId}
Retrieve customer details by their ID.


List All Customers:

Method: GET
URL: /customers
Retrieve a list of all customers.


Update Customer Details:

Method: PUT
URL: /customers/{customerId}
Request body: JSON with updated customer details.


Delete a Customer:

Method: DELETE
URL: /customers/{customerId}
Delete a customer by their ID.
For this microservice, you should use Java and Spring Boot. Additionally, you'll use the H2 in-memory database for storing customer data. Your microservice should be testable with unit and integration tests.
